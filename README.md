# PyGame Space Invader
So just like everyone learning python and pygame I decided to make a game or clone one in this case. This is a space invader game with my few tweaks to it, I might make more changes to it in the future but for now I think I've got good progress. Any ideas, tips and criticism are welcome as this is my first code on github.
