INTRODUCTION

Space Invader is a classic arcade game where players control a spaceship to shoot down invading alien ships while avoiding their projectiles. This implementation uses the Pygame library, which provides functionalities for game development in Python.

HOW TO RUN THE GAME

To run the Space Invader game:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the Pygame library using pip: `pip install pygame`.
3. Download the source code files from the provided repository.
4. Run the `game.py` file using Python: python `game.py`.
5. Enjoy playing the game!

GAME FEATURES

* Player Control: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the player's spaceship horizontally.
* Shooting: Press the mouse button to fire bullets from the spaceship to destroy enemy ships.
* Enemy Ships: Multiple enemy ships move horizontally and vertically on the screen, trying to reach the bottom. Shoot them down to earn points.
* Scoring System: Earn points by destroying enemy ships. The score is displayed on the screen.
* Background Music and Sound Effects: Enjoy immersive gameplay with background music and sound effects for shooting and enemy contact.
* Game Over: The game ends when an enemy ship reaches the bottom of the screen or when the player's spaceship collides with an enemy ship. The game over screen is displayed with the final score.

CODE STRUCTURE

The code for the Space Invader game is organized into several sections:

* Initialization: Importing necessary libraries, initializing Pygame, setting up the game window, loading images and sounds, and setting initial game parameters.
* Game Loop: The main game loop where player input is processed, game state is updated (player movement, enemy movement, bullet movement, collision detection), and screen is updated.
* Functions: Helper functions for rendering game elements (player, enemy, bullets), handling collisions, displaying text (score, game over), and controlling game events (firing bullets).
* Event Handling: Processing user input events such as key presses and mouse clicks to control the player's spaceship and fire bullets.
* Main Execution: Starting the game loop and updating the game state continuously until the game is quit or ended.

The code is well-commented to explain the purpose of each section and function, making it easy to understand and modify.
